QuickList
=====
Quick and easy Todo list manager


## About
QuickList is a simple app written in pure HTML/CSS and Javascript. It uses HTML5 localStorage for storing data.
It features two todo-lists as I discovered I needed one for short-term tasks and one for long-term tasks. Hopefully it will benefit some others as well.

The app is built via PhoneGap and will be published to app stores after I've gone through some testing/bugfixing. I only have Android to test on so if anyone are interested to try it please let me know.


# Install instructions
